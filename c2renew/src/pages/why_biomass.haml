      Utilizing biomass fillers offer the benefits of reduced material cost while maintaining mechanical
      properties and providing a green alternative. Biomass fillers can reduce the cost of polymers by using
      low cost biomass in place of expensive base resins. Using our experience and formulation techniques,
      we are able to maintain or improve most mechanical properties while incorporating biomass fillers. 
      These formulations are more environmentally responsible since the petroleum feedstock can be
      replaced with agricultural byproducts which would otherwise be left to decay in the soil or sent to the
      landfill.
