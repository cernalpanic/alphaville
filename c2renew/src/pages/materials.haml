      c2renew designs custom formulations for each customer to produce a biocomposite specifically for 
      their application. We can work with your company at the design stage to tailor make the biocomposite
      for the part as well as help design the part for the application. If the part is already designed or in 
      production, we can also produce a biocomposite formulation which will serve as a drop in replacement 
      for a polymer. c2renew has experience working with a wide variety of thermoplastics including PP, PE, 
      PLA, ABS, ABS/PC, PA and more. We have experience using a multitude of agricultural inputs as fillers in 
      our materials such as flax fiber, flax shive, wood flour, sunflower hull, dried distiller grains with solubles, 
      soybean hull, oat hull, sugar beet pulp, etc. With our experience and technology, our formulations 
      are dependent on no single biomass source; we can use different combinations to maintain the same 
      properties and cost. For higher temperature thermoplastics such as ABS or PA, we use thermally 
      stabilized biomass to prevent off gassing during production.
